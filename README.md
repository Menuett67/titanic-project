Hello,
this is Titanic- Machine learning project whhich i have done.
The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning for training and testing models. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including details like age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival based on these features.
